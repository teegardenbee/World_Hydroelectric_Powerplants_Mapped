# World_Hydroelectric_Powerplants_Mapped

I came across a huge dataset which contained information about all the hydroelectric power plants of the world.
The dataset contained a lot of information including the latitude, longitude, capacity, etc of each project.
For mapping this dataset, I used pandas for filtering the relevant data and folium to map it.
